GitSocket
=========
After going through some pains in attempting to get Post-Receive Hooks working
for my server, I decided to instead use Git's WebHook request
(POST to given URL when pushing to BRANCH) to trigger a git-pull.

This code is very self-explanatory.

Please DO NOT execute the code without first
checking it out and modifying it for your own needs!

Using
-----
1) Setup Git WebHook to your URL and PORT of choice.
2) Initialize GitSocket to listen on the port you provided for the WebHook
as well as the PATH of the repository you intend to modify.
3) Run GitSocket and let the pushes flow in.
